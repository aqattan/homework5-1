                        Manchester rivals City and United have been drawn to face each other in the fourth round of the EFL Cup.
                        United saw off League One Northampton on Wednesday, while City won 2-1 at Swansea to set up the second meeting of the two teams this season following City's derby win on 10 September.

                         After three straight defeats, all eyes were on Jose Mourinho's men to respond on Wednesday night and they got off to the perfect start when Michael Carrick (17) curled home, but Alex Revell (42) levelled the game from the spot just before half-time.

                        Victory was enough to lift Max Allegri's side back to the top of the table as title rivals Napoli were held 0-0 away at Genoa.Elsewhere, Edin Dzeko scored twice as Roma beat Crotone 4-0 to move up to third, Inter Milan made it back-to-back wins with a 2-0 victory over Empoli and Udinese drew 2-2 with Fiorentina.
